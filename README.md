# What

Submission for a pathfinding coding challenge. Visit the app [here](https://reittihaku-jhn.herokuapp.com/).

The application must find the shortest path between two traffic stops, provide the visited stops and the distance travelled.

## Technologies

Backend is a node express app and frontend is a plain html/vanilla javascript user interface with absolutely zero flare or glimmer. Just because.

## Implementation

The application uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and keeps record of the traversed nodes along the shortest path to reconstruct the exact route.
